## Basian Classifier for Linearly separable data
##### There are four cases :

1. **taskA** : Covariance matrix for all the classes is the same and is σ<sup>2</sup>I.
2. **taskB** : Full Covariance matrix for all the classes is the same and is Σ.
3. **taskC** : Covariance matric is diagonal and is different for each class.
4. **taskD** : Full Covariance matrix for each class is different.
